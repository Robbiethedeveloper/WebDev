Notes
Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.  Padding creates space inside the box.
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.  Margin creates space outside the box.

Padding values cannot be negative and the initial value for all padding properties is 0.

syntax of padding:  padding: <padding-top> || <padding-right> || <padding-bottom> || <padding-left>  OR
                  <padding:top>
                  <padding:right>
                  <padding-bottom>
                  <padding-left>
      If only 3 values are entered then the first value applies to the top, 2nd value on both the left and right side, and the last value on the bottom.
      If only 2 values are entered then the first value is applied to the top and bottom, and the 2nd value applies to the right and left.
      If only one value, then this applies to all 4 sides.

Its important to note that if a percentage value is used, then it is relative to the total width of the container not the height.  So if you use <padding: 10% 15%> then this will applied 10% of the top and bottom padding based on the headers width and 15% to the left and right side also based on the width.
      You can test this by adjust the browser first vertically and note that the padding doesn't change but it will change when adjusting horizontally.


Border needs 3 things to be viewable: width, style and color.
      If not color is defined, then this will inherit text color of the header.

Border width Syntax: border-width: <border-width - top> || <border-width - right> || <border-width - bottom> || <border-width - left>
      these same syntax applies for Border-style and border-color as well.
      If only 3 values are entered then the first value applies to the top, 2nd value on both the left and right side, and the last value on the bottom.
      If only 2 values are entered then the first value is applied to the top and bottom, and the 2nd value applies to the right and left.
      If only one value, then this applies to all 4 sides.

You can shorten all 3 of these properties with the below syntax:
      border: <width> <style> <color>; you can rearrange the properties and still get the same output such as : border: <color> <width> <style>

You can overrride one of these by putting it below.  such as if you wanted a different bottom border, then put this past the initial border declaration

Margin works just like padding and uses the same syntax as padding.

Margin doesn't change the measurement of the box it is in due to being the space outside of the border.

Margin separates one rectangular CSS box from another and doesn't impact the measurement of any element.

Margin can use negative values to close up space between two elements.  There is no such thing as negative padding or negative borders though.

In a footer, if you lower the width of the amount you might want to center that to a page.  change the left right to auto.  This will center the element to the middle.  This sets the left and right margins to be equal and centers the element.
This doesn't work for vertically centering a box though.  Only left and right margins.

Less commonly used as the max-width property, there are min-width, max-height, and min-height properties as well.

vw - viewport width 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.  a 1440pixil monitor in width 10vw is equal to 144pixels.
vh - viewport height 1vh is 1% of the viewport height

You can enter vh heights greater than 100.
